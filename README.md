# Project A1 - Penguins & Abalone
- Datasets: Penguins and Abalone datasets.

- Main tasks:
1. Load datasets and divide into train and test, see if balanced.
2. Train and test classifiers:
   - Decision Tree with default parameters.
   - Decision Tree with different choices of criterion, maximum depth and minimum samples split.
   - Multilayered Perceptron with 2 hidden layers, SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) and sigmoid activation function.
   - Previous MLP but experimenting with the activation functions, architecture and solver.
3. Statistics of the previous classifiers: confusion matrix, recall, F1 (these three for the classes) and accuracy, macro-average/weighted-average/variation F1  (for the model).
4. Analysis of performance.

- Files:
1. main: Contains the solution to all the exercises proposed in the instructions.
2. functions: Contains all the classifiers and functions to (a)compute some metrics, (b)print information, and (c)evaluate all the models.
